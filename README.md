Responsive Project Landing Page
==========

A responsive project landing page built upon [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) which I have handcrafted for one of my project [Markdownify](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990/electron-markdownify).

Perfect for the Open Source projects which can be described within a single page. Such as [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and as it is built upon Bootstrap, it can customizable pretty easily according to your liking.

Take a look at the [demo](http://www.amitmerchant.com/responsive-project-landing-page/).
