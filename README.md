Responsive Project Landing Page
==========

A responsive project landing page built upon [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) which I have handcrafter for one of my project [Markdownify](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990/electron-markdownify).

Perfect for the Open Source projects which can be described within a single page. And as it is built upon Bootstrap, it can customizable pretty easily according to your liking.
